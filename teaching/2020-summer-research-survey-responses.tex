I would like to work with Dr. Rapson on developing and then teaching a summer astronomy outreach curriculum and training how to use the portable sky some. I've worked with Dr Finn on the breyo to build a flat field device, Dr Bellis on testing air samples to explain DAMA/LIBRA data, and currently working with Dr Bellis on a quantum board game.

I'm interested in summer research because I believe that research is one of my strengths in science in general since I've been doing research since my sophomore year in high school (I did research on astrobiology but focused on habitable planets). I also think that by working with a professor during the summer would give me a good feel as to how research is conducted at Siena and how I might go about doing personal/individual research in the future. I have learned some python last semester and I'm willing to learn more and increase my python fluency.  Dr. Bellis offered and asked if I wanted to do summer research with him regarding galaxy formation and the python coding, and I would really love to!

I am interested in participating in summer research so that I can further my understanding of and fulfill my love of physics. Throughout my past college math and physics classes I have continued to grow my understanding and interest in the many different areas of physics and astronomy. In addition, I learned in SCDV110 that programming is very interesting and a wonderful challenge. I am hoping that over this summer I can not only grow my love of physics but also improve my knowledge and skill when it comes to programming. Over this summer I am interested in working with Astronomy and more specifically Dark Energy and Dark Matter. My high school physics teacher briefly taught me about Dark Energy and the wonders of it and since then I have been fascinated with the concept of it. After talking to Dr. Moustakas I am even more interested in the mystery of it and would love to work with him on his Dark Energy projects this summer. I hope that this will further my understanding of Astronomy and Dark Energy and keep me wondering more about the many questions of the universe.

I want to construct and or build an apparatus this summer. The projects that interest me are the “Big G” project with Dr. Vernizzi  and the “Cloud Chamber” project with Dr. Bellis.    I worked with Dr. Vernizzi last semester on his Gravitational Constant project. I worked with a Raspberry Pi and Unix operating system. I have had about six years of off and on experience with Python 2 and 3.

I am interested in summer research because I would like to become familiar with the practice of conducting research with other scientists. I feel that I would benefit from the experience in manner regards, including personal enjoyment. I would like to work with dark energy research and data systems to aid the effort of DESI in viewing our night sky. I want to do research with Prof. Moustakas on his DESI projects. I have 5 years of coding experience and designing web infrastructure on my own time. For many years I have dreamed of having the opportunity to do research with a professor in college and this would achieve that goal.
